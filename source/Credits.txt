/
	A big thank you to everyone who's supported the project during these years
	- it would have	never gotten to where it is now without your help.
	
	SCP-CB has been a big collaborative effort with dozens (maybe even hundreds?)
	of people creating material and giving ideas and feedback for the game, and
	I'm sure I've forgotten to mention some of you here. If you've contributed
	something to the game and would like your name to be added here, drop
	me a message on the Undertow Games forum or contact@undertowgames.com!
	
	- Joonas Rikkonen ("Regalis")

	Huge thanks to those who supported the development of the Remastered Mod!
	- another huge thanks to the Ultimate Edition Team and those who assisted
	  them for the amazing starting point for us.

	Love you cuties.
	- Remastered Team
